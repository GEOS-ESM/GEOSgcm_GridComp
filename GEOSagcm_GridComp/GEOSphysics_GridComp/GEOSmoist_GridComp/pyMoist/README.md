# pyMoist

`pyMoist` is the [NDSL](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/NDSL) version of the NASA GMAO's GEOS Moist physics and it's required interface to GEOS.

Legend:

- Numerical: numerical regression vs Fortran on a C24 resolution. See testing.
- Integration: integrating the NDSL code (python) in the current GEOS (fortran), either via direct C-binding and/or via an experimental MAPLpy layer
- Scientific: running 7 days at C180 on Discover/PRISM with expert review
- CPU: speed up (>1) or slow down (<1) versus the Fortran, with the resolution noted
- GPU: idem CPU but on the device, with a "generation to generation" comparison

## Testing

The `tests/savepoint` folder contains the numerical regression testing that served to port the code from the original Fortran. It tests that the difference from original Fortran is minimal.

Note: bit to bit equivalence is not possible considering the targeted hardware and the change of compiled language (NDSL uses C).

## Interface

The `interface` sub-directory contain the three-way bridge to and from GEOS.

## Develop

- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before comitting for code guidelines coherency.
