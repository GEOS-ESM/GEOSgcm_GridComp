  !                         - moved "small" back from catch_constants() into snowrt()
  ! reichle, 14 Aug 2014 - moved constants that are only needed in subroutine catchment() 
  !                         to catchment.F90 where they are now private to the F90 module 
  !                         "catchment_model"
  !                      - removed all constants that come straight from MAPL_Constants
  !                      - renamed all remaining public constants by prefacing with "catch_*"
  !                      - moved "echo_catch_constants()" to catchment.F90 (and renamed)
  ! Sarith,  10 Nov 2015 - moved SHR, EPSILON, SCONST, CSOIL_1,  CSOIL_2, N_sm, and SATCAPFR here
  !                        from land models.
  !                      - added routing model constants  N_Pfafs_LandCatchs and N_Pfaf_Catchs
  ! Justin,  12 Apr 2018 - removed ifdef LAND_UPD, moved CSOIL_2 to SurfParams
  ! reichle, 27 Jan 2022 - cleanup: moved "public" constants from lsm_routines to here; added "CATCH_" prefix

  ! layer depth associated with snow-free land surface soil temperatures
  !
  ! ==================
  ! Note by Randy Koster & Rolf Reichle when CSOIL=200. was still used (~2018):
  ! DZTC = .05 is a hardwired setting of the depth of the bottom of
  ! the surface soil layer.  It should be made a parameter that is tied to
  ! the heat capacity CSOIL, which had been set to either CSOIL_1 or
  ! CSOIL_2 based on vegetation type.  For now we leave
  ! it set to 0.05 despite an apparent inconsistency with CSOIL as
  ! currently used.  We do this (again, for now) because the effects of the
  ! inconsistency are drowned out by our arbitrary assumption, in computing
  ! the thermal conductivities, that the unsaturated soil has a degree of
  ! saturation of 50%.  For the flux calculation, setting the depth to .05m
  ! here provides approximately the same fluxes as setting the depth to much
  ! closer to 0 (as the value of CSOIL_2 suggests) and assuming a degree of
  ! saturation of about 25%, which is no less realistic an assumption.  There
  ! are other impacts in wet climates regarding the effect of
  ! the depth of the water table on the thermal conductivity; these impacts
  ! are presumably very small.
  ! ==================
  !
  ! DZTSURF (formerly DZTC) is the layer depth associated w/ surface soil temperatures:
  !   Catchment:    tc1, tc2, tc4  (CSOIL also includes veg canopy)
