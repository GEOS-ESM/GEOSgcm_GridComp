This directory contains software to create restarts and bcs for
all tile components, not just catch.

The five restarts are created in ./OutData/ by simply 
running mk_Restarts (no arguments) from the command line.
This builds the two executables, if necessary. One executable
does all the land grid files (two restarts, an lai-grn file, and
two albedo files). The other executable can be used, with appropriate
arguments (see mk_Restarts) to create the othe three restarts.

Before running mk_Restarts you must checkout the InData and OutData
subdirectories, and place the input data there.
(see READMEs in these two directories).

For convenience we have place copies on the MAPL hash software in
this directory, so that the restarts can be created without building
MAPL.

The directory also contains legacy software by M Kistler that may
still be needed for Eros and for early Fortuna tags.

On 11/23/2009 Max made changes to sense if the input restart is old (i.e., has the 2
pairs of prev/next variables or not. By default it produces an new
restart, compatible with Fortuna-2_0 and later. By adding a 4th, optional,
argument of "OutIsOld", it will produce a valid old restart. Note that
any other string as a 4th argument, or no 4th argument will produce
the new restart.
